## Introduction ##
Bombermen is a computer arcade game based on the classic Dynablaster and Atomic bomberman specified to be highly configurable and playable, to be one of the best network bomberman games. Bombermen implies/implements all the features of the mentioned classical games, highly supports network games and has some new concepts of gameplay. Changing settings/turning off these features gives the possibility of operating exactly like the ancestors.

New concepts include that players have vitality. That means they do not die when the fire of a bomb reaches them, they will be damaged depending on several factors. This new concept gives reason for existance of another new concept: the multiple fire concept. This means for example that if a level component (a wall or a player itself) can be damaged on a higher degree if fire of several bomb reaches it.

The name **Bombermen** itself (plural of Bomberman) alludes at its strong network support, its multiplayer support.
